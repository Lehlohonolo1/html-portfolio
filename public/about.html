<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Lehlohonolo Mofokeng. A young man who was born and bred in the township called Mohlakeng.</p>

<p>I'm a very curious person, Going a day without learning anything new is a sin in my world, it does not matter if it is small or big.</p>

<p>My dream is to be one of the best web developers in this planet. When I mention coding or programmming, my heart burns, becuase I'm hungry for this. If you are reading this and you think you can help me achieve my goal/dream. Do not hesitate to call me.</p>
